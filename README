snatk is a set of analysis tools developed by Brian W. Mulligan for processing information related to supernovae. 
Many of the tools are related to working with the compact-circumstellar shell interaction model (Mulligan & Wheeler, 2017). Those specific tools are located in the SuShI (supernova-shell interation).
There are a variety of tools that are less specific to that model, and many tools dedicated to working with syn++ output, and spectra.

statepop is tool that is curently being devleoped that determines the state populations for a single element across all or many ion species in the regime of a strong radiation field.

Prerequisites:
	autotools
	pkg-config
	libtool
	openmp compatable compiler
	HDF5
	jsoncpp
	yamlcpp
	es / syn++ (Important: you need my fork to get the library: https://github.com/astrobit/es)
	xlibs (https://github.com/astrobit/xlibs)
	BWM801 engine (https://github.com/Astronaos/BWM801) -- optional: required for some interative SuShI tools


Installation:
	mkdir mk4
	libtoolize	
	aclocal
	automake --add-missing
	autoconf
	./configure --prefix=/your/local/install/path
	make
	make install

If you prefer to install to /usr you may leave out the --prefix part of the ./configure line.
