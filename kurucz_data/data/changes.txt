Some discrepancies have been found in these data in the process of using them for the statepop project. The changes that I have made are listed below in this file

Si I
79338.5 cm^-1 and 79355.02 cm^-1 level were labeled as either 3d 2D or 2d 2D. Since 2d is an impossible configuration, all of those instances were relabeled as 3d 2D.
62667.823 were labeled as either 6f [5] or 6f [7]. Martin & Zalubas (1983) list this as 6f [7] so references were updated accordingly.
